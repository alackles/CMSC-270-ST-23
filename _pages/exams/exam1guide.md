Your individual exam will be a **paper exam** consisting of **conceptual questions related to the course topics**. There will _not_ be any C++ syntax on the exam. There _will_ be conceptual questions related to programming in C++, in particular pointers and an understanding of linked-list data structure implementations.

The following topics may be covered (not all will be).

- Big-Oh runtime
- Abstract Data Types and their associated operations
  - Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Deques
- Array-Based Data Structures
  - Array-based list implementations and their associated trade-offs
  - Stack/Queue/Deque implementations and their associated trade-offs
  - How to conceptually visualize these structures and their associated operations
  - Times when it is appropriate to use these structures
- Linked List Based Data Structures
  - Singly vs. Doubly linked lists: implementation
  - Linked list implementations and their associated trade-offs 
  - How to conceptually visualize these structures and their associated operations
  - Times when it is appropriate to use these structures

The following topics will _not_ be covered.

- Specific big-Oh runtimes of any operations or calculations of runtime 
- Syntax for pointers (address-of `&` and dereference `*` operators)
- Templates/overrides/namespaces
- Linked-list based stacks/queues/deques (they are subsumed by the List)

## How to Study

Go back to the data structures and their implementatios. Try first working with the data structures in C++ code, then try drawing out the data structures that you have created in the code. Can you follow along with the `display()` method of each function at each step? Can you follow along with what is happening _between_ displays of the data structure?
