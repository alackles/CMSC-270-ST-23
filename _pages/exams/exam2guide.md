Your individual exam will be a **paper exam** consisting of **conceptual questions related to the course topics**. There will _not_ be any C++ syntax on the exam. There _will_ be conceptual questions related to programming in C++, in particular pointers and an understanding of linked-list data structure implementations.

The following topics may be covered (not all will be).

- Big-Oh runtime
- Comparison of abstract data types
  - Lists, stacks, queues, deques, sets -- definitions
  - Scenarios in which it is appropriate to use one kind of data structure over another
- Searching and Sorting
  - Linear search and binary search
  - Insertion sort and merge sort 
  - Runtime of sorting algorithms
  - Runtime of searching algorithms 
- Tree-Based Data Structures
  - Binary trees vs. balanced binary trees - the difference between the two
  - How to conceptually visualize binary tree structures and their associated operations
  - Implementations of binary trees and their trade-offs 
  - Traversal of binary trees (breadth-first vs depth-first)

The following topics will _not_ be covered.

- Syntax for addition and removal from any data structures
- Inductive proofs 
- Heaps

## How to Study

Go back to the data structures and their implementatios. Try first working with the data structures in C++ code, then try drawing out the data structures that you have created in the code. 

Return to your Homeworks 3 and 4 to note any feedback you have received, and try revising those assignments based on the feedback. (Feedback for Homework 4 will be posted by the end of the day Thursday.) 

Go back to your first exam; what were the places that your feedback indicated you needed to focus in?
